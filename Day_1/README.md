# Day1 : Introduction to Verilog RTL and Synthesis

## Key points:
introduction to open-source simulator iverilog

labs using iverilog and gtkwave

introduction to yosys and logic synthesis

labs using yosys and sky130pdks



## let's start with the day1,

### Simulator:

RTL design is checked for adherence to specifications by simulating the design.

Simulator is tool used for simulating the design. here we use iverilog for our course.


### Design:

Design is the actual verilog code or set of verilog codes which has the intended functionality to meet with the required specifications.


### Testbench:

Testbench is the setup to apply stimulas (test_vectors) to the design to check its functionality.

### Synthesizer:

It is tool used for converting RTL to netlist.

Here we used yosys as a synthesizer.

So these are some insights of day1.





## Also i have made some notes
